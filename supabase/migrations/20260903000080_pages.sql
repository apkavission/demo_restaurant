-- ===========================================================================
-- A business writes its own pages.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- **The owner's instruction.**
--
--   > demos wale me … sab kuch chaiye seo, marketing and content dynamic and
--   > pages banane
--
-- Every demo ships with the same six or seven pages, one file each. A business
-- that wants an eighth — "Our story", "Insurance we accept", "Careers" — could
-- not have one, and there was nowhere to put it if they had.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- **Sections as rows, not as a blob of JSON.**
--
-- The company website stores a page's sections as JSON because it has a builder
-- with thirty section types and a schema per type. Nothing here needs that, and
-- a JSON column would give up everything the rest of these schemas rely on:
-- ordering by a column, a foreign key to the picture, and a policy that can see
-- inside the row. Sections are rows, ordered like every other list in this
-- database.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- **A slug is unique per business, not per demo.** The three businesses in a
-- demo are three different companies as far as anybody reading them is
-- concerned, and each may perfectly well have an "about" page.

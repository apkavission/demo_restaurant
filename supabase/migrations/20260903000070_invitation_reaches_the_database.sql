-- **What was wrong.**
--
--   > jitna bhi chej h ye yaad rakhna ki kisi ka bhi url koi aur access na kar
--   > sake … kuch bhi browser me leak mat chodna
--
-- Every variant in this schema is `link_only`, and `can_view` enforces that
-- faithfully — in `proxy.ts`. The database did not enforce it at all.
--
--     variants_public_read      using (is_active)
--     courses_public_read       using (status = 'published')
--     faculty_public_read       using (status = 'published')
--     …
--
-- Not one of those policies asks *who is asking*. They were written when the
-- only question was "is this row finished", because every demo was public and
-- there was no such thing as a visitor who should be turned away. Closing the
-- demos changed the question and left the answers alone.
--
-- The consequence, measured rather than imagined: a request to PostgREST
-- carrying nothing but the publishable key returned a row from every one of the
-- six schemas. That key is not a secret — it is shipped to browsers by design,
-- and one of these demos is currently public, so it can be read out of a page
-- by anybody. Every published course, doctor, listing, product, price and
-- testimonial belonging to every business was readable by somebody who had
-- never been sent a link at all.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- **The token travels in a header, and the database reads it.**
--
-- PostgREST puts the request's headers in `request.headers`, so a policy can
-- ask the same question `can_view` asks: is there a live, unrevoked, unexpired
-- share link with this token? The application sends the header from the cookie
-- it already sets when a link is redeemed.
--
-- **This is not a new credential to guard.** The header carries the token from
-- the link. Somebody who can send it is somebody who was sent the link — which
-- is precisely the permission being checked. Forging it means guessing the
-- token, and a guessed one is looked up like any other.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- **The policies are amended, not replaced.**
--
-- Each existing `*_public_read` rule keeps whatever it already said — mostly
-- `status = 'published'`, which is still true and still wanted — and gains one
-- more condition. Rewriting fifty-one of them by hand across six schemas is how
-- one gets missed, and the one that gets missed is the leak.

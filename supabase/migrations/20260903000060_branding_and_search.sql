-- `variants` has carried `logo_light_id`, `logo_dark_id` and `og_image_id`
-- since it was written and every one of them is null, because there was no
-- screen to set them from and no bucket to hold a file. Both now exist.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- **What the schema was actually missing.**
--
-- Not the logo — that column was there. It was *how to use it*: a mark on its
-- own beside a separate wordmark is a different design from a lockup that
-- already contains the name, and drawing the business name beside a logo that
-- already says it is the commonest way a header looks amateur. One column
-- answers it.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- **The search fields fall back rather than being required.**
--
-- A variant with no meta title uses its business name and tagline, which are
-- always there. A demo built in an afternoon must never render a blank
-- `<title>` because somebody did not reach the SEO screen.

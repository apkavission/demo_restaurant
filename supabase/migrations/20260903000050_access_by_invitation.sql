--
-- Three changes, and each answers one clause of that.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- **1. Every variant closes.**
--
-- 'visibility' has meant public by default since the schema was written, and
-- all eighteen still were: the demo we spent a month building could be read by
-- anybody who guessed /dental, including the competitor a prospect forwards it
-- to. The default flips, and the rows already made flip with it. Opening one to
-- the world afterwards is a deliberate edit by a super admin, which is what it
-- should always have been.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- **2. Every opening is a row, not just a number.**
--
-- 'view_count' answers "how many". It cannot answer the question actually asked
-- across a table — *when* did they look, was it once on the day we sent it or
-- four times the week they were deciding, did they open it again after the
-- meeting. That is a row per opening.
--
-- Coarse on purpose: a browser and where they came from, never an address and
-- nothing that follows a person between visits. This is a record of our own
-- sales link being used, not surveillance of somebody we are pitching to.
--
-- **What counts as an opening.** Not a page. A prospect who reads six pages
-- opened the link once, and a count that said six would be worthless for the
-- one conversation it exists for. So a visit is counted at most once every
-- thirty minutes — a return the next day is a second opening, a click through
-- to the menu is not.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- **3. A dead link says what happened — to whoever is holding it.**
--
-- The expired screen was deliberately vague about every failure, so that
-- somebody trying tokens learned nothing. That reasoning holds for a *guessed*
-- token and fails for a real one: the client we sent it to, whose link ran out
-- on Friday, is told nothing they can act on and concludes our work is broken.
--
-- 'link_state' answers only for a token that exists — which requires already
-- holding it, so there is nothing left to leak — and says nothing at all for
-- one that does not.

 *              which date, which is the difference between a client asking for
 *              a new link and a client deciding we are unreliable.
 *   revoked  — closed by hand.
 *   used_up  — the view limit was reached.
 *   unknown  — no such token. Nothing else is returned, ever.
 *
 * **Why this may safely say more than can_view does.** can_view is asked about
 * an address anybody can type. This is asked about a token, and knowing a token
 * requires having been sent it — so there is nothing new to learn here by
 * guessing, and an honest visitor gets an answer they can act on.

-- 4. The bug that closing the doors uncovered.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/*
  `can_view` raised an error for every visitor arriving without a link.

  It held both the variant and the link in `record` variables. A record that is
  never assigned has no shape at all, so reading a field of one is not null —
  it is:

      record "link" is not assigned yet
      The tuple structure of a not-yet-assigned record is indeterminate.

  The `select ... into link` only runs when a token was presented, so a visitor
  with no token reached `if link.id is null` with nothing assigned and the whole
  request failed. Not the expired screen: a 500.

  It never fired before today because every variant was `public`, and the public
  branch returns before that line. Closing the doors above makes the no-token
  path the ordinary one — the first stranger to open the demo would have met a
  broken site — so the fix belongs in the same migration as the change that
  exposes it, and not one deploy later.

  The repair is to hold plain variables instead of records. A scalar that has
  not been assigned is null, which is what every line below already assumed.

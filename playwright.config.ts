 * What a visitor sees, and what a visitor must not.

 * **Nobody signs in.** Everything worth testing about a demo happens before a
 * sign-in: the shop loads, the switcher moves between businesses, the panel
 * refuses, and a link-only business is not reachable by typing its address.
 * Testing the panel would need the owner's own session, which is a manual step
 * per machine, and it would not test the thing these are for.
 *
 * Two widths, because a demo is opened on a phone at least as often as on a
 * laptop -- somebody forwards the link and it is read on the train.

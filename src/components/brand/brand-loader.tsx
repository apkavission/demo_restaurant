/**
 * The loader. This one, everywhere.
 *
 * A standing instruction from the owner, and it binds this project as much as
 * the company website: **one loader across the estate** — the mark, the words
 * arriving from the left and the right, and the rising arrow drawing itself
 * underneath.
 *
 * **The first version of this file got that wrong.** It rendered the name as
 * text with an animation of my own devising and no logo at all. That was two
 * mistakes: it changed something that was already settled, and it dropped the
 * mark. This is the company website's loader, reproduced — same structure, same
 * keyframes, same easing, same arrow.
 *
 * Written again here rather than imported, because this application must not
 * depend on the website. The cost of that decision is exactly this file and the
 * four SVGs in `public/brand/`, kept in step by hand.
 *
 * **One thing is deliberately absent**: the company site puts a small WebGL
 * field behind the lockup on its full-screen loader. That needs three.js, which
 * is a large dependency for atmosphere on a screen nobody is meant to look at
 * for long, so it is not here. Everything a person actually recognises — the
 * mark, the entrance, the breathing, the arrow — is.

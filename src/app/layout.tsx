/**
 * Every family a business may be set in, built here and chosen per request.
 *
 * `next/font` self-hosts from a literal call at build time, so the whole list
 * has to exist in the bundle before a database row can name one of them. The
 * row stores a key into `lib/fonts.ts`; `themeCss()` points `--font-heading`
 * and `--font-body` at the pair that key names.
 *
 * **Nine families in the CSS is not nine downloads.** Each `@font-face` is
 * declared, and a browser fetches a face only when something on the page is set
 * in it — which, on any one variant, is two of them.
 *
 * Written out one by one because they must be: `next/font` reads its options at
 * compile time, so a loop over a list of names does not compile.

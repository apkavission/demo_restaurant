/**
 * Who is running the panel.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * **There is no account list in this application, and there must not be one.**
 *
 * The estate has exactly one: `company.profiles` in the company website, with a
 * role from `company.roles` and an `app_access` array saying which of the six
 * applications each account may reach. This schema reads its own row of that
 * through `demo_resto.me`, a view that returns the caller and nobody else.
 *
 * A second list here would mean adding a colleague twice, and removing them
 * once — which is the failure that matters, because the one you forget is the
 * one that keeps working.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * **Two levels, because the owner asked for a dashboard that differs by role.**
 *
 *   **admin** — the content: services, doctors, reviews, questions, and the
 *   appointments and messages that come in. The day-to-day.
 *   **super admin** — everything above, plus the two things that decide what
 *   this demo *is*: which businesses exist, and who has been sent a link to
 *   which one.
 *
 * The split is not cosmetic. Issuing a share link is handing somebody outside
 * the company a view of our work, and cloning a variant changes what every
 * future prospect sees. Both belong with whoever is accountable for the estate,
 * which is the same person `is_owner` already identifies everywhere else.

 * The schema this application reads.
 *
 * Its own, and nobody else's. Where the tracker and the panel deliberately share
 * `portal` — because they are two views of one company's work — a demo shares
 * nothing with anything. `demo_resto` holds three invented clinics, and a
 * migration here cannot reach any real data because there is none within reach.
 *
 * The one exception is deliberate and one-directional: `demo_resto.is_admin()`
 * reads `company.profiles` to answer "may this account open the panel", so the
 * estate has one account list rather than six. It reads two columns of one row
 * and fails towards "not an admin".

 * were forked from the clinic and every one of them kept asking for `clinic`
 * access in `auth.ts` -- a string in the middle of a file nobody re-reads. An
 * account with the right access for its own demo could not open it, and an

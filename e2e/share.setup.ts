/**
 * A way in, for the rest of the suite.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * **Why this exists.** Since 2026-09-03 a demo is opened by invitation: typing
 * a business's address gets the expired screen, and only a browser holding a
 * live share link gets the site. Every spec here navigates straight to an
 * address, so without this they all test the expired screen — which is how
 * eighteen of these tests started failing in one afternoon.
 *
 * That is not a workaround. The suite now takes the path a prospect takes:
 * redeem the link, then read the site.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * **One link per business, not one for the demo.**
 *
 * A link opens *one* business — that is the point of it. A single link would
 * send every spec to the same place, and "the three businesses do not share a
 * heading" would fail with three identical headings, blaming the site for
 * something the setup did.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * **It writes rows, and cleans up after itself.** The links are labelled so
 * anybody who finds them in the panel knows what they are, every run removes
 * what the last one left, and they expire in a day so a crashed run does not
 * leave a live door open.

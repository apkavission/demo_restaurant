      without overwriting the manifest the dev server is reading. The output is
      still compiled JavaScript, and eslint has no idea it is not source: one
      verification build turned a clean lint into **7,470 problems** — 395 of
      them errors, every one of them in a bundle nobody wrote. Glob rather than
      a fixed name, because the point of the variable is that the name varies.

      Every server action takes the previous form state as its first argument
      whether it needs it or not — that is `useActionState`'s contract, not a
      choice. Warning about it teaches people to ignore warnings, which is worse
      than the unused argument ever was. Naming it `_previous` says the same
      thing to a reader and keeps the rule useful for genuine mistakes.

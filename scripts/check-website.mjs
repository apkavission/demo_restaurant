/**
 * Does the Website screen actually work — in a browser, against the real
 * database — and does a theme change reach the public site?
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * **Why a script and not a Playwright spec.** The suite runs as a visitor
 * holding a share link; this needs the owner, signed in. It starts from the
 * session the company website's own suite saves — the cookies there are scoped
 * to `localhost` without a port, so one signed-in session serves all nine
 * applications — and signs in itself when that session has expired, which it
 * had when this was first run: eight days old and dead, and the check reported
 * the Website screen as a sign-in form. That reads like "the screen is broken"
 * and means "this session is old", so a stale session is not a failure here.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * **It writes to the real database, and puts everything back.** Every value it
 * touches is read first and written again at the end, and the last check is
 * that the demo was left as it was found. A check that leaves a client's demo
 * in a colour nobody chose is worse than no check.
 *
 * Run it with the demo's dev server up:
 *
 *     npm run dev            # in one terminal
 *     npm run check:website  # in another

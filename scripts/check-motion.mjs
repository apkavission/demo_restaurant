/**
 * Does the motion ever hide anything?
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * **The one way animation breaks a page.** A reveal that starts hidden and
 * depends on something to finish it — a script, a scroll timeline the browser
 * does not have, a stylesheet that arrived late — leaves the content invisible.
 * Nobody notices in the browser it was built in, and it is total: not "looks
 * wrong", but "the section is not there". It is worst for exactly the people
 * most likely to be using assistive technology or an older browser.
 *
 * So this is not a check that the animation is pretty. It is a check that
 * every band is **readable in all four states**: freshly loaded, scrolled to,
 * with reduced motion asked for, and with the reveal switched off entirely.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * **All seven routes, not the front page.** Until 2026-09-12 this asked its
 * questions of `/` alone, which was the only page with any motion on it. The
 * six pages behind the menu now carry the same band, the same reveals and the
 * same counters — and a reveal that hides a heading is exactly as total on
 * `/services` as it is on the home page, with nobody watching that one.
 *
 * **And two kinds of hiding, not one.** Opacity was the only way a band could
 * be invisible when this was written. It is not any more: a heading rises out
 * of a clipped box, so the wrapper is fully opaque while the words inside it
 * are translated out of sight. A check that asks about opacity alone passes a
 * page whose every section heading is missing — which is precisely what
 * happened the first time the clipped reveal was built, and it was caught by
 * looking at a picture rather than by this file.
 *
 * Run it with the dev server up:
 *
 *     npm run dev
 *     npm run check:motion
